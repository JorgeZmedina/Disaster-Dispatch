        <h1 class="card-title">Volunteer With Us</h1>
        <p class="card-sub-title">Volunteering for natural disasters can be an incredibly rewarding experience that allows individuals to make a significant impact in their community. When natural disasters strike,
                 they can leave a devastating aftermath, leaving communities struggling to recover. By volunteering, individuals can offer their time and skills to assist in various tasks such as
                  clearing debris, providing food and shelter, and even emotional support. Volunteering for natural disasters also provides an opportunity for individuals to learn new skills, make
                   new connections, and gain a sense of purpose by helping others. It's essential to ensure that individuals are adequately trained and prepared to handle the challenges that come 
                   with volunteering for natural disasters, but the benefits of giving back to those in need are immeasurable.</p>

        <h1 class="card-title">Why Are We Here</h1>
        <p class="card-sub-title">People help clean up after natural disasters because they recognize the immense impact that these events can have on communities and the individuals affected by them. Natural disasters
                 can leave a trail of destruction and debris, making it difficult for those affected to recover and return to their daily lives. By helping to clean up, individuals can make a meaningful
                  contribution towards restoring normalcy and providing much-needed support. Additionally, volunteering for clean-up efforts can provide individuals with a sense of purpose, community
                   involvement, and the opportunity to make a positive impact in the lives of others.</p>
